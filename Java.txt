// Java
// High level muti-paradim language
// capable of compile to platform-indepedent byte code without recompiling
// which made possible by interpreter Java Virtual Machine(JVM)
// and comupter only need Java Runtime Environment(JRE)
// write once and run anywhere

// static: A member of a class, belongs to type, as opposed to the instance of a class

// JVM exist in RAM
// .java file compile to .class file which consist byte code
// JVM Class_Loader > Byte_Code_Verifier > Excution_Engine
// Just_In_Time compiling

// Compilation => platform dependent thus faster
// Interpretation => platform independent thus slower
// Java uses both
